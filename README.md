# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Deep Learning
So first of all what the diabetic retinopathy means?
 Diabetic retinopathy is an disease of eye caused to an person due to diabetes,it is the condition in which person's eye is damaged due to mellitus present in human eye. It is basically occurs when the blood form several droplets on to the retina and it remain collected at that perticular place and this affect the person and if it occur in more extent then an person can lead towards blindliness due to the cause called Diabetic Rectinopathy.
   present in human eye. 
   
here is an compartion of an normal person's ey eand an diabetic retinopahy's patient's eye

## Diabetic-Retinopathy has several stages 

0 - No DR     (DR = Diabetic Retinopathy)

1 - Mild

2 - Moderate

3 - Severe

4 - Proliferative DR


So what out Deep Learning Model will do?

It will Predict the stage of diabetic retinopathy on the bases of photo which is to  be uploaded by the user.

Here is an Deep Learning model https://github.com/kamlesh11/Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning/blob/master/diabetic-retinopathy-detector.ipynb  

And we also made an web app through which any Person can use this technology and get benifit of it.

Thank-you!!!
